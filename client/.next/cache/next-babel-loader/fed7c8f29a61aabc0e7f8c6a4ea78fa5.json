Consent\\n\\nKnowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information except where required or permitted by law. Providing us with your Personal Information is always your choice. However, your decision not to provide certain information may limit our ability to provide you with our products or services.

You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information, and may request that it be amended, if appropriate. However, in certain circumstances permitted by law, we will not disclose certain information to you. For example, we may not disclose information relating to you if other individuals are referenced or if there are legal, security or commercial proprietary restrictions.\\n\\n \\n\\n10. Handling Customer Complaints and Suggestions \\n\\nYou may direct any questions or enquiries with respect to our privacy policy or our practices by\\n\\ncontacting:\\n\\n \\n\\n[Contact Information]\\n\\n \\n\\nAdditional Information\\n\\n \\n\\nCookies\\n\\nA cookie is a small computer file or piece of information that may be stored in your computer's hard drive when you visit our websites.
